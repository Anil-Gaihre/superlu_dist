1. Install:
   (at top level directory)
   bash run_cmake_summit.sh
   cd summit_build
   make
   make install

2. build example driver 'psdrive'
   (at top level directory)
   cd EXAMPLE
   make psdrive

3. run psdrive:
   (at top level directory)
   cd EXAMPLE
   bash batch_summit_1cpu1gpu.sh

   (look for the following line to try different matrices:
     for  MAT in Geo_1438.mtx
   )

4. SRC/sSchCompUdt-cuda.c contains the call to SGEMM


------------------
Performance tuning parameters:

MAX_BUFFER_SIZE : controls how much Schur-complement GEMM is on GPU.
		  If it's large enough, can limit partition to 1, which has
		  the smallest overhead in data transfer between CPU & GPU.

N_GEMM : 

FP_MIN: in util.c: 200000/(nbrow*ldu)
	Is 200000 is smallest flops that can be done efficiently with 1 stream
	of cuBLAS call?
